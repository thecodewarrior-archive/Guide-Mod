Cobblestone wall
</title>

<tool>
<image src="" />
</tool>

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

Fence

<content>
Fences are wall blocks that cannot be jumped over.

Fences come in two main varieties, wood, and <guide href="minecraft:nether_brick">nether brick</guide>.

Wood fences are broken most quickly with an <guide href="minecraft:axe">axe</guide>, but will drop when broken with any tool. Nether brick fences require a <guide href="minecraft:pickaxe">pickaxe</guide> to get it back, mining it with anything else will drop nothing.

In Minecraft version 1.8+ fences come in all the wood varieties: Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Dark Oak, and Acacia.

Cobblestone wall
</title>

<tool>
<image src="" />
</tool>

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

Cobblestone wall

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

Fences are wall blocks that cannot be jumped over.

Fences come in two main varieties, wood, and <guide href="minecraft:nether_brick">nether brick</guide>.

Wood fences are broken most quickly with an <guide href="minecraft:axe">axe</guide>, but will drop when broken with any tool. Nether brick fences require a <guide href="minecraft:pickaxe">pickaxe</guide> to get it back, mining it with anything else will drop nothing.

In Minecraft version 1.8+ fences come in all the wood varieties: Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Dark Oak, and Acacia.

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Fence

<content>
Fences are wall blocks that cannot be jumped over.

Fences come in two main varieties, wood, and <guide href="minecraft:nether_brick">nether brick</guide>.

Wood fences are broken most quickly with an <guide href="minecraft:axe">axe</guide>, but will drop when broken with any tool. Nether brick fences require a <guide href="minecraft:pickaxe">pickaxe</guide> to get it back, mining it with anything else will drop nothing.

In Minecraft version 1.8+ fences come in all the wood varieties: Oak, Spruce, Birch, Jungle, Dark Oak, and Acacia.

Cobblestone wall
</title>

<tool>

<content>
The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls

<content>
Lava is one of two <guide href="minecraft:liquid">liquids</guide> in vanilla minecraft and is found in underground pools at <guide href="minecraft:z-level">levels</guide> 1 through 10 and rarely on the surface as lakes or lava-falls.

<image src="minecraft:dimensions/nether/overview"/>

Lava will light the player on fire if touched and will destroy items if they land in it.

Lava emits a <guide href="minecraft:light">light level</guide> of 15

Lava can be stopped from flowing by ladders, fences, and signs, without them lighting on fire and being destroyed.

Shooting an arrow through flowing lava (though not source blocks) will light the arrow on fire, causing it to light any mob it hits on fire

Interactions between Lava and Water
<indent>
If lava flows on top of still or running water, it creates stone.

If lava flows horizontally into water, cobblestone is created.

If water flows horizontally into lava, a hiss and puff of smoke occur but nothing changes.

If water flows vertically into lava, cobblestone or a hiss may result.

If water flows into a lava source block then obsidian is created. The lava spring is destroyed in the process, so unlike cobblestone it is not continuous and renewable.

If vertically falling water touches a lava source block on any side obsidian is created - even if the water would not run into the lava's square.
